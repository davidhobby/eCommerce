# Credentials Folder

## The purpose of this folder is to store all credentials needed to log into your server and databases. This is important for many reasons. But the two most important reasons is
    1. Grading , servers and databases will be logged into to check code and functionality of application. Not changes will be unless directed and coordinated with the team.
    2. Help. If help is needed with a team issue, this folder will help facilitate this giving the instructor all needed info AND instructions for logging into your team's server.

If a ssh key is used please upload the key to the credentials folder.

Database URL or IP and port used. csc667-group8.caamxby8fquc.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com Port: 3306

Database username: dbuser

Database password: csc667_group8

Database name: ecommercedb
